Player Y’s Side (Player Y’s play direction is counter-clockwise)
E3 and F3 is the container of current dice throw

1)The starting state must be written into the file.

2) Throw of one dice each side to determine the first turn. (You may generate a random number independently for
each dice between 1 and 6 integer only)(Dice no1 is for player X, Dice no2 is for player Y. The higher side will roll
double dice to play first.

3)For example the player X won the dice roll and throw 3-1(Dice no1=3, Dice no2:1) only the player enters the source
slot, player enters E1 and G1 so computer change the E1 to “2X”, H1 to “X” (for dice 1)and computer changes the G1
to “4X” and H1 to “2X”. ,(if the dices are rolled and a double dice came like 1-1, 2-2….6-6. This dice will be played as 4
times the single dice- 4-4 means 4 times 4)
So the new Table.dat will be like below:
Player X’s Side (Player X’s play direction is clockwise)
